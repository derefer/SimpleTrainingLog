# A Traditional Training Log

This is an exercise to port and refactor my original "KTrainer" project written in 2008 in Qt4 to Qt5.

The project is now called "SimpleTrainingLog".

The purpose of it is to provide basic functionalities to log training related data.

It is not using any online services.

All the data comes from the user and stored offline.
